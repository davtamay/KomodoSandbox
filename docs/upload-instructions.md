5. Save the file to your computer.

If for some reason you cannot access this website, download the GLB, or are having other problems, please email your mood board image directly to Brandon. Please use PNG, JPG, or BMP file formats. Try to avoid PDF if possible.

## Upload a GLB to Komodo

1. Make sure you are on the Komodo > Assets page.
3. Press `+ Upload`.
4. Fill out required details: 
   1. Choose File 
   2. Asset Name
   3. Description 
   4. Public/Private:
      1. Public: <img width="114" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-28 at 4 21 33 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8165314/112768416-ab57be80-8fe1-11eb-81d8-55ed894a1dbb.png"> -- The circle MUST be to the right for it to be public.

5. Skip optional details: 
   1. "3D Model"  -- This might be called "Treat as Whole Object" in older versions. 
      1. On
      2. Avoid using Model Pack for komodo-relay v1.1.0 and up and komodo-unity (Core) v0.4.0 and up. Our apologies.
   2. Scale
      1. 1
6. Press `Upload` and wait for the preview.
7. Go back to `Assets` (left sidebar).

## Upload multiple copies

Each model is synchronized between everyone, so you may want more than one copy in the lab.

1. Repeat the above steps to upload multiple copies.
2. You can re-upload one GLB multiple times.
3. You can use the same name for multiple assets.

## Re-upload any unwanted assets.

Unfortunately, editing and deletion are not available at this time for non-administrator users. Please re-upload any assets in order to change the details. It's probably a good idea to put "Version 2", "Version 3", etc. in the description so an admin can delete the correct version.

If you would like to delete an asset, please email an admin.

## Add the models to the lab

1. Go to a lab detail page.
2. Press the three vertical dots ("...") and choose Edit
3. Check the box beside each model you want to include
4. Press Schedule
    1. Some versions of the portal will get stuck on "Scheduling...". In this situation, press the Back button in your browser. We apologize for the inconvenience.
5. Refresh any existing WebXR Client sessions, because models are added at load time, not at runtime.

## Footnotes
1. Uploading files from a standalone VR headset or a mobile phone is not supported at this time.
2. This tool turns the image into a 3D model. We need this step because Komodo only imports GLB files. If you cannot access this website, email an admin.
3. The model preview may look incorrect. The web viewer does not support GLB extensions, and its lighting is unchangeable. It should look fine in the WebXR Client itself.
